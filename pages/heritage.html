            <h4>Grandfather: Mr. Odarmetey (Laryea)</h4>
            <p><strong>Birth Name:</strong> Laryea</p>
            <p><strong>Known As:</strong> Mr. Odarmetey</p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Story Behind the Name:</strong> As a child, Mr. Laryea
              was under the care of Mr. Odarmetey. When he went to school, there
              was a mistake with his name registration, and he was enrolled as
              "Odarmetey." Rather than correct this error when he grew up, he
              chose to keep the name Odarmetey as a way to honor the man who had
              cared for him. However, all of his children carry the family name
              Laryea, preserving the original family lineage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Legacy:</strong> A testament to gratitude and honor -
              choosing to carry the name of someone who showed him care and
              kindness.

        <h3>Family Traditions & Values</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Core Values Passed Down:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Honor and Gratitude:</strong> Exemplified by Mr. Laryea's
              choice to keep the Odarmetey name to honor his caregiver
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Family Unity:</strong> Staying connected and supporting
              each other across generations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Respect for Elders:</strong> Honoring those who came
              before us and their sacrifices
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cultural Pride:</strong> Remembering and celebrating our
              heritage and roots
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legacy Preservation:</strong> Maintaining family names and
              stories for future generations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Education as Foundation:</strong> Mr. Odarmetey
              established that every family member is required to achieve at
              least a degree or some level of recognized educational
              qualification. This requirement stems from his own missed
              educational opportunities - he enforced this rule to ensure that
              future generations would have the chances he never had, breaking
              the cycle and creating a foundation for success.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Family Traditions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sharing family stories to preserve our history</li>
            <li>Celebrating milestones and achievements together</li>
            <li>Honoring the memory of our ancestors</li>
            <li>Maintaining connections across different family branches</li>
            <li>
              <strong>First Paycheck Blessing Tradition:</strong> When someone
              receives their first paycheck, they bring it to the nuclear
              family. Each family member can take any amount from the paycheck
              (or simply touch it as a symbolic gesture) and then pray for the
              person or bless the money. After everyone has participated, the
              whole family joins together in prayer for the person's success and
              prosperity. This beautiful tradition typically sees family members
              taking modest amounts (the highest known being around $5),
              ensuring it doesn't burden the earner while creating a meaningful
              blessing ceremony that celebrates new beginnings and family
              support.
            </li>

              Mr. Odarmetey's Educational Legacy - Despite not having the
              educational opportunities himself, he established a family
              requirement that every member must achieve at least a degree or
              recognized educational qualification, ensuring his descendants
              would have the chances he was denied
